# -Analog-Digital-Communication-Systems-Simulation-in-GNU-Octave
Octave simulations for analog signal analysis, FDM modulation, line coding, and digital modulation techniques ASK.
This repository contains my team implementation of the communication systems course project using GNU Octave , covering both analog and digital communication systems as part of the curriculum in the Electronics and Communication Department.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The course project is divided into two major parts:

Analog Communication System Simulation
Signal analysis in time and frequency domains
Fourier Transform derivation and numerical computation
LPF filtering and bandwidth estimation
FDM Modulation using DSB-SC and SSB techniques
Coherent demodulation of received signals
Digital Communication System Simulation
Line coding simulation using Manchester,uniPolar NRZ
Digital modulation ASK 
Coherent detection with variable phase offset
Time-domain and spectral domain visualization
